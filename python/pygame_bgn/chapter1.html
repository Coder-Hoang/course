    <h1 class="title">Chapter 1: How does video games work?</h1>

    <h2 class="partone">How does movie work?</h2>

    <h3 class="partoneex">Movies come alive through a rapid sequence of still images, called frames. Imagine a flipbook where each page has a 
        slightly different picture. When you quickly flip through the pages, the individual images blend together, creating the illusion of movement. 
        Similarly, movies project a series of frames in rapid succession (typically 24, 30, or 60 frames per second) onto a screen. 
        This creates the smooth motion and visual experience we enjoy in theaters and at home.</h3>

    <h2 class="parttwo">How does video games work?</h2>

    <h3 class="parttwoex">Video games share the core principle of movies: creating the illusion of movement by displaying a rapid sequence of 
        images, or frames.  Typically, these frames update at a rate of 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (FPS).  
        However, video games go beyond this passive experience by incorporating user input. This user input allows for real-time interaction. 
        For instance, pressing the WASD keys on a keyboard moves the game character, while clicking the mouse button might trigger an action like shooting.  
        Game controllers offer even more diverse input options, providing a wider range of control for players.</h3>

    <h2 class="parttwo">How does Pygame Helps you to create games?</h2>
    <h3 class="parttwoex">
        Pygame is a powerful and beginner-friendly Python library that empowers you to create engaging 2D video games. 
        It acts as a bridge between your creative ideas and the technical aspects of game development. 
        Pygame handles the low-level tasks like rendering graphics, managing audio, and detecting user input (keyboard, mouse, joystick). 
        This frees you to focus on the core gameplay mechanics, character design, and overall game logic. 
        With Pygame, you can create simple games like Pong or platformers, and as your skills progress, 
        you can build more complex games with features like physics simulation and intricate animations. 
        Pygame's approachable nature makes it a fantastic starting point for aspiring game developers, allowing them to learn the 
        fundamentals of game development within a familiar Python environment.</h3>
